In the introduction to this collection, we argue that this `polycrisis' is fracturing the European political system across multiple, simultaneous rifts, thereby creating a `polycleavage'. As a consequence, the EU is caught in a `politics trap'. Similar to other decision traps, this multi-level politics trap is dysfunctional, but difficult to escape altogether. The contributions to this collection analyze the mechanisms of the politics trap, its relationship to the European polycrisis, and the strategies pursued by a plurality of actors (the Commission, the European Parliament, national governments) to cope with its constraints. In light of this analysis, we argue that comprehensive, `grand' bargains are for the moment out of reach, but national and supranational actors can find ways of `relaxing' the politics trap and in so doing perhaps lay the foundations for more ambitious future solutions.},

It looks specifically at issues of teacher availability, recruitment, and retention for at-risk and hard-to-staff schools and offers guidance to education policymakers as they work to improve teacher quality and staff all classrooms with highly qualified teachers. Among its findings is that although the profession continues to be attractive and job satisfaction is high among most teachers, polls find that one in four teachers is planning to leave the profession, including 17 percent of new teachers who say they are likely to leave. Moreover, administrators in urban and mainly minority schools and districts report widespread teacher shortages. However, many teachers profess a willingness to move to hard-to-staff schools if there are high levels of administrator support. Reasons for these findings as well as the favorability of potential policy solutions are discussed. Additional Information on the Polls Reviewed is appended. (Contains 9 tables and 3 footnotes.)},

This essay explores literature on conceptual change and motivation to put forth fresh ideas on how curricula can foster science acceptance, or the willingness to engage in critical evaluation of evidence even when it holds potential to contradict one's preferred conclusion. Drawing from motivated reasoning and self-determination theories, this essay builds a theoretical model of how negative emotions, thwarting of basic psychological needs, and the backfire effect interact to undermine critical evaluation of evidence, leading to science denial. The model guides the proposal of several design principles for creating instruction that is likely to foster science acceptance, and puts forth the evidence-laden narrative as an exemplar. This essay calls for instructional methods that facilitate motivation toward accuracy goals by fulfilling basic psychological needs as students engage in accuracy-oriented reasoning while evaluating evidence. The conclusion suggests further lines of research that might improve our understanding of science denial and how it can be confronted in the classroom.},

Design/methodology/approach               Data were obtained from a survey of 387 university students enrolled in an entrepreneurship course, who were asked to respond to the same questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the semester. To test the proposed hypotheses, comparison of means tests for independent samples were carried out.                                         Findings               The results obtained confirm that students with a role model teacher perceive that entrepreneurial competencies and perceived behavioural control increase largely during the course, whilst students with a non-role model teacher perceive that their attitude towards intention decrease.                                         Originality/value               The ``Who should teach?'' question has been disregarded in previous entrepreneurship education (EE) literature. The current paper is a first step towards a better comprehension of the teacher of entrepreneurship as a role model.},

Thus, they affect teachers' everyday work and are among their professional competencies. While general values and some single profession-specific values of teachers (e.g., responsibility) have already been investigated empirically, the current study aims to cover a broader range of profession-specific values by developing and validating the T{\"u}bingen Inventory to Measure Teachers' Profession-Specific Value Orientations (TIVO), based on three independent studies with pre-service (Studies 1 and 2; N               1               = 334, N               2               = 239) and in-service teachers (N               3               = 308). The results demonstrate that the TIVO is appropriate to assess four profession-specific values in a second-order model: caring, justice, responsibility, and truthfulness as first-order factors, with fairness as a second-order factor loading on the latter three first-order factors. The results from preregistered experiments and confirmatory factor analysis provide consistent evidence for the construct validity of the TIVO.},

The study overcomes limitations in prior studies in that it (1) assessed personal characteristics before study entry in order to exclude "contamination" effects, (2) selected an appropriate control group, and (3) differentiated between STEM and non-STEM study majors. The results did not find any empirical support for the negative selection hypothesis in terms of cognitive and personality characteristics in Germany.

Hence, values have predictive and explanatory potential at both the individual and the societal levels. Moreover, values can reflect major social change in societies and across nations. And values may influence the direction and speed of social change. Survey researchers, like other social scientists, view values as basic, abstract motivations. In practice, however, they distinguish little between values and attitudes. They usually measure values with sets of attitude questions in specific domains of life such as religion, morality, politics and work, and they sometimes infer or derive broad underlying values statistically from arrays of attitudes, such as tradition vs. secular-rational values. This chapter presents a theory of ten basic human values intended to encompass the major distinctive value orientations recognised across cultures.
